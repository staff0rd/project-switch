description: Commit only relevant files from the session
---

Review the git status and create a commit with only the files that are relevant to the current session. Write a clear, concise commit message that describes what changed and why. Do not reference Claude or any AI assistance in the commit message.

Use npm run commit with a message that is:

- 40 characters or less
- Does not reference Claude

Instead of using git commit directly, use: npm run commit -- "your message"
